# Vim configuration

Here is my Vim configuration aimed at Golang development.

It uses [pathogen][1] as plugin manager.
Here is the list of [plugins](plugins).


### Install

Clone this repo and run the installer:

`git clone https://github.com/TheoBrigitte/vim ~/.vim && ~/.vim/install.sh`

Note: It will backup your current .vimrc file.
